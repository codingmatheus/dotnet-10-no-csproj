- intro
 - .NET 10 just introduced a major change. You are now able to run C# without a csproj file! 
 - this brings it closer to Python or NodeJs which in my opinion is a long time coming cuz now you can use C# like a scripting language without having to worry
 - let's see how this works
 about a whole framework
- create App.cs
- Console.WriteLine("Hello, .NET10 and C#14!)
- run it 
- what if we want to add packages?
- intro to Cowsay
    - show web page
- add package in #:package Cowsay
- add using Cowsay;
- create a static cow
- modify Console.Writeline with staticCow.Say()
- closing, CTA code is in my github , link in the description
